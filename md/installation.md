# Installation
---

This is a basic guide on how to install and setup Sober. If you don't know, Sober is as the developers say "...an unofficial port of Roblox to Linux.
No emulators or virtual machines. Up to twice the performance of native Windows" ([Sober Developers](https://sober.vinegarhq.org/)).

## Installing Sober

Sober is pretty easy to install, you will need the following to install and use Sober:

* An x86_64 computer with SSE4 instruction set or higher. (CPU for 2013+ should be fine)
* A modern Linux distrobution (Ex: Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 40, Linux Mint 21)
* A Vulkan 1.1+ capable graphics card, check [FAQ](../docs/FAQ.html) for more info.
* Flatpak installed on your system.

>  If you don't have Flatpak installed on your system, you can install it by going to https://flatpak.org/setup/ and following the guide there for the installation of Flatpak.

Once you have Flatpak installed on your system, you can either download the Flatpak link for your software center [here](https://sober.vinegarhq.org/sober.flatpakref), or you can run:  `flatpak install --user https://sober.vinegarhq.org/sober.flatpakref` in your terminal.
